## Interesting Projects I've worked on üèó

### Attack Surface Management Platform with integrated Threat Intel 
Developed a comprehensive Threat Intelligence (TI) integrated Attack Surface Management (ASM) platform designed to provide a holistic view of an organization's attack surface.

The platform automates the discovery of all digital assets, including those that might be overlooked, ensuring nothing is left unaccounted for. It goes beyond traditional asset management by assessing both digital assets and personnel, identifying potential vulnerabilities associated with people within the organization.

Additionally, the platform includes a dark web scraping feature that actively monitors and identifies threats, providing actionable intelligence to help organizations stay ahead of potential attacks.

This project underscores my focus on building advanced security solutions that empower organizations to manage their attack surfaces proactively and effectively.

### Phishing Infrastructure
One of the most exciting projects in my cybersecurity journey was building a Phishing Infrastructure from the ground up. I started with GoPhish, a powerful tool for crafting and managing phishing campaigns. It felt like I was constructing a virtual battleground, where every email and every click was a move in a strategic game.

But I didn‚Äôt stop there. To ensure smooth and reliable email delivery, I integrated Postfix into the setup. It was like fine-tuning an engine, making sure everything ran smoothly behind the scenes. The result? A fully operational phishing infrastructure, capable of simulating real-world attacks in a controlled environment.

This project wasn‚Äôt just about building a tool‚Äîit was about understanding the mindset of both attackers and defenders. It gave me a deeper appreciation of the nuances involved in phishing campaigns and the critical importance of robust security measures.

This is just one chapter in my offensive security story, and I‚Äôm eager to continue exploring the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity.

### Vulnerability Database Repository
The journey began with building a robust API server in Python, secured with KeyCloak as the OAuth Auth Server. The goal was clear: to create a centralized repository where all CVEs from multiple customers could be accumulated, updated, and easily accessed by the entire team.

This repository isn‚Äôt just a storage solution; it‚Äôs a critical tool for accelerating remediation efforts. By having all CVEs in one place, the team can quickly cross-reference vulnerabilities, share insights, and deploy fixes faster than ever before. The system ensures that every reported vulnerability is logged, tracked, and ready for action, minimizing the time between discovery and resolution.

### Counterfeit Product Detection system
One of the most intriguing projects I‚Äôve tackled was building a Counterfeit Product Detection system. It all started with the challenge of identifying fake products across the vast expanse of online marketplaces and social platforms‚Äîa problem that affects countless consumers and brands.

I developed a crawler that scoured the internet, gathering data from various online platforms where products were being sold. The real magic happened when the system began attributing the original product's details and comparing them with the online listings. It wasn‚Äôt just a simple check; the system analyzed multiple parameters, from product descriptions to images and seller information.

To add a layer of precision, I implemented a scoring system that assessed the likelihood of a product being counterfeit. Each parameter contributed to this score, providing a clear, data-driven indication of whether a product was genuine or fake.

This project was a deep dive into the intersection of technology, consumer protection, and brand integrity. It‚Äôs a testament to the power of data and algorithms in tackling real-world problems.
