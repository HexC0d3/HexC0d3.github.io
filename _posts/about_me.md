ðŸš€ Hi everyone! I'm Himanshu, a passionate Cybersecurity Enthusiast with over 5 years of experience in the field. I have a deep love for the color RED of Offensive Securityâ€”a space where I thrive. I am curious mind and evergreen learner.

ðŸ”§ In my free time, I enjoy building and automating projects, always looking for new challenges to tackle. When I'm not diving into Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, you can catch me enjoying some downtime with video games.

Always excited to connect with like-minded professionals and share knowledge! ðŸ’»ðŸ”’
I talk about Networks, Exploits, Threats, Leaks, OSINT , Darkweb and anything worth noting in Cyber Space.
